ISDC Project - Implementing a Matrix Class using Python

In this project, I've created a Matrix class in Python, and implemented methods for calculating the determinant, trace, inverse, and transpose of a matrix. I've also overloaded the operators for adding, subtracting and multiplying matrices.

This project includes the following files:
1. <b>matrix.py</b> - This contains the Matrix class implementation.
2. <b>matrix_playground.ipynb</b> - This Jupyter notebook is used for testing the Matrix class implementation. It imports the Matrix class and calls the test code.
3. <b>matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb</b> - This Jupyter notebook includes a description of matrix notation and a list of matrix equations. 
4. <b>kalman_filter_demo.ipynb</b> - This Jupyter notebook uses the matrix class to implement a Kalman Filter
5. <b>test.py</b> - This contains the code for testing the Matrix class implementation.
6. <b>datagenerator.py</b> - This contains helper code for implementing the Kalman Filter.
